            <h2>Account Registration</h2>
            <p>To access certain features, you must create an account. You agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Provide accurate, current, and complete information</li>
                <li>Maintain and update your information as needed</li>

                <li>Accept responsibility for all activities under your account</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
            <h3>You agree to use Kaavala only for lawful purposes. You must NOT:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Trigger false SOS alerts or make fake emergency reports</li>
                <li>Use the App to harass, threaten, or harm others</li>

                <li>Share inappropriate or illegal content through the App</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>False Alerts:</strong> Deliberately triggering false SOS alerts wastes critical resources and may result in immediate account termination. In some jurisdictions, false emergency reports may also be a criminal offense.
            </div>

            <h2>Volunteer Services</h2>
            <p>Kaavala connects users with volunteer escorts who have undergone KYC verification. However:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Volunteers are independent individuals, not our employees</li>
                <li>We do not guarantee volunteer availability at all times</li>
                <li>We conduct verification but cannot guarantee volunteer behavior</li>
                <li>Users should exercise their own judgment when accepting escort assistance</li>
                <li>Both users and volunteers must treat each other with respect</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Volunteer Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>If you register as a volunteer, you additionally agree to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Complete identity verification (KYC) truthfully</li>
                <li>Respond to alerts only when able to provide genuine assistance</li>
                <li>Behave professionally and respectfully at all times</li>
                <li>Not request or accept payment from users</li>
                <li>Report any concerning behavior through proper channels</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Location Services</h2>
            <p>Kaavala requires access to your device's location services to function properly. By using location-based features, you consent to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collection of your location data when features are active</li>
                <li>Sharing your location with emergency contacts during SOS events</li>
                <li>Sharing your location with volunteers during escort services</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can disable location services at any time through your device settings, but this will limit the App's functionality.</p>

            <h2>Content and Evidence</h2>
            <p>The App allows you to record audio, video, and photos during emergencies. You are solely responsible for any content you create and share through the App. You agree that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You will only record content where legally permitted</li>
                <li>You will not record or share content that violates others' privacy rights</li>
                <li>Evidence recorded through the App may be used by you for legal purposes</li>
                <li>We may access evidence data if required by law or to investigate violations</li>
            </ul>
